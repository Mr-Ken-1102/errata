/**
 * Server-authoritative registry of in-flight LLM runs.
 *
 * Every LLM generation — librarian chat, prose generation, character chat,
 * refine, prose-transform — executes as a *run*: a detached async body that
 * appends events to an in-memory log. HTTP requests are only ever *subscribers*
 * to that log, reading from a cursor.
 *
 * The invariant that makes this work: `emit` never throws and never blocks on a
 * consumer. A client that disconnects (a backgrounded phone tab, a dropped
 * mobile connection) simply stops reading; the run body is unaffected and runs
 * to completion, persisting its result. Only an explicit `cancelRun` aborts.
 *
 * Scope: in-process only, like `withKeyLock` and `active-registry`. The app is a
 * single Bun process, so an in-memory log is sufficient. Durability across a
 * server restart comes from each surface persisting incrementally as it streams,
 * not from journalling this log.
